## Question: Are there significant differences in hyperdrive ratings between starships from different manufacturers?

Using the [starships.csv file]() from the [Star Wars Dataverse](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/star-wars), we aim to answer the above question by implementing statistical tests including one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson and Spearman correlation tests, and running linear regression.
