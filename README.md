## Question: Are there significant differences in hyperdrive ratings between starships from different manufacturers?

Using the [Star Wars Dataverse] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/star-wars), namely the [starships.csv file] (), we aim to answer the above question by implementing statistical tests including one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson and Spearman correlation tests, and running linear regression.
